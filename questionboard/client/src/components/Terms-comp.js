        This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions which apply to the use by you of the Question Board website

        Definitions.

        interactive online service operated by Question Board on the World Wide Web. The site consists of information
        services and content provided its content created and potentially third parties.<br /><br />
        General:<br />
        Question Board shall have the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature including, but
        not limited to, private sections, potential Community Areas, content, hours of availability, and equipment
        needed for access or use. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately
        upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including but not limited to, posting on the Community Areas a
        revised version of this Agreement or notification by electronic mail. Any use by you of the Community Areas
        after such notice shall conclusively be deemed to be acceptance by you of such changes, modifications, additions
        or deletions. You agree to review the terms and conditions of this Agreement periodically to be aware of such

        otherwise objectionable, which encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, gives rise to civil
        liability or otherwise violates any law. No conduct shall be undertaken that, in Daily Jorunal's judgment,
        restricts or inhibits any other user from using or enjoying the Posting Area. Advertising or commercial

        Do not incorporate any content from this site into your site (e.g., by in-lining, framing or creating other
        browser or border environments around the content). The purpose is to create a private journal, so you many may
        only link, not replicate, site content.
        Provided you have written documentation supporting your claim to relationship (as declared in your link) with
        Question Board, you may use services provided they link to the corresponding page, the site’s home page.
        Your site must not present false information about products or services.
        Your site should not contain content that could be construed as distasteful, offensive or controversial.
        Question Board created and operates this web site. If you use our materials from locations outside of the United
        States, you are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. You are bound by any such revisions and
        should therefore periodically visit this page to review the current version of the policy.<br />
        Subscription Services; Products:<br /><br />
        Subscription Services. As of now, Question Board is a free platform for you to use. Nothing is ever certain, so
        that is subject to chane. If a subscription service is offered, it will be available to users with other paid
        services and products. The following terms and conditions shall apply in the event that you subscribe to any
        subscription service or services offered:
        Subscription Terms. The Subscription will continue until notification of termination from you as described in
        subsection C below. If you accepted an offer that included a free trial period, your credit card account will
        not be charged until after the end of the free trial period. If you ordered in response to a free trial period
        offer, you may cancel the subscription process and avoid a charge to your credit card account by going to
        reaching out to support. Current fees may be obtained by going to the Smart Statement. You are responsible for
        any charges associated to connecting to the Question Board site, including but not limited to, any telephone
        line charges or any Internet access provider charges. You shall provide Question Board with accurate, complete
        and updated information as to your name and e-mail address and credit card account information provided by you
        at registration. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement.
        Changed Terms. If any such change is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your Subscription as provided in
        subsection C below. Any use of the Subscription by you after such notice shall conclusively be deemed to
        constitute acceptance by you of such changes, modifications, additions or deletions. You agree to review the
        terms and conditions periodically to be aware of such revisions. You may also be subject to additional terms and
        conditions imposed by third party content providers in connection with third party content, software or
        services.<br /><br />
        Termination.<br />
        Either you or Question Board may terminate this Agreement at any time. Your only right with respect
        to any dissatisfaction with (i) any terms and conditions of this Agreement, or policy or practice of Question
        Board in operating the site and/or the Posting Area, (ii) content available through the Subscription or change
        therein, or (iii) amount or type of fees or billing methods, or change therein, is to terminate this Agreement
        by sending notice to Time-Life Customer Service, 1450 East Parham Road, Richmond, Virginia 23228, by e-mail sent
        to our Help Form, or by going to the Subscription Summary accessible from the Smart Statement and following the
        directions listed. Notice of termination will be effective upon receipt by Question Board without limiting the
        foregoing, we shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement with respect to any user, in its sole
        discretion, considers to be unacceptable, or in the event of any breach by you of this Agreement. In the event
        that your account is terminated or canceled, no refund of any fees, including monthly membership fee, will be
        granted. The provisions of Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and this Section 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement.
        Fees paid for any Subscription are paid in advance and are not refundable in whole or in part, provided,
        however, that in the event of termination by Question Board for any reason other than breach of this Agreement
        by you or termination by you in accordance with this subsection C of this Agreement in which you identify the
        termination as resulting from changed terms, Question Board shall make a pro rata refund to you.
        Products and Other Services. With respect to products and services offered for sale and third parties or through
        the site: you shall be informed of all terms of the offer, including but not limited to pricing, methods of
        payment, credit card information, sales tax, return and refund policies and applicable privacy policies on the
        screen where you make the purchase.<br /><br />
        Miscellaneous.<br /><br />
        This Agreement and any operating rules for the Question Board site and the Posting Area established by Question
        Board constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede
        all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement
        shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of
        laws rules. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
        preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall
        not be given any legal import.
